# Simple Text Viewer

This is a simple text viewer console application written in C#. It allows users to open text files and view their contents directly in the console. Not a very useful project but a step up for me with C#,

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Type "open" to open a file.
3. Enter the file path when prompted.
4. The program will display the contents of the file if found.
5. Type "exit" to quit the program.

## Features

- Opens text files.
- Displays the contents of the file in the console.
- Handles file not found errors gracefully.

## Usage Notes

- Ensure that the file path provided is correct.
- Supported file formats are text files (.txt).
